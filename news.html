                    <p> India and Australia are advancing discussions on a comprehensive trade deal following the successful conclusion of a preliminary free trade agreement (FTA) last year. The seventh round of talks, concluded on October 20, involves negotiations on five tracks and 14 new areas, including digital trade, government procurement, MSMEs, traditional knowledge, sports, gender, environment, innovations, space, labour, and competition policy. The countries are making progress on formal talks in areas such as goods, services, digital trade, government procurement, and product-specific rules of origin. India's exports to Australia increased by 17% to $4.9 billion in the first half of 2023-24, while imports declined by 24.6% to $8.3 billion. Both nations aim to conclude a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) by the end of the year, building on the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) operationalized in December last year. </p>

                    <p>India accomplished a major achievement with its successful second trial of an indigenous naval anti-ship missile, a collaborative effort between the DRDO and the Indian Navy. The Guided Flight Trials on November 21 marked a significant stride toward self-sufficiency in missile technology. Launched from a Sea King 42B helicopter, the missile incorporates advanced navigation and avionics systems. In October, the Indian Navy disclosed preparations for the inaugural trial of a Long Range Anti-Ship Missile developed by DRDO, surpassing the range of the BrahMos missile. The BrahMos, initially with a range of 290 km, now extends to 350-400 km. March witnessed the effective firing of the MRSAM from INS Visakhapatnam, showcasing the Navy's capability to intercept anti-ship missiles. The MRSAM collaboration involved DRDO, Israeli Aerospace Industries, and Bharat Dynamics Limited. India continues to advance its missile capabilities, reinforcing its naval defence.</p>
